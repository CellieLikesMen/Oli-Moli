HOW TO USE OLI MOLI
=================

1. CHINESE WALK
--------------
This feature continuously presses the 'W' key for you.

Setup:
- Type your trigger key in the "Trigger Key" box (default is 'C')
- Use the slider to set the delay between key presses (30-50ms recommended)

How to use:
- Press your trigger key once to start Chinese Walk
- The toggle button will turn black when it's running
- Press the trigger key again to stop
- The program will keep pressing 'W' until you turn it off

2. QUICK SWITCH
--------------
This feature helps with weapon switching by pressing 'Q'.

Setup:
- Type your trigger key in the "Trigger Key" box
- Adjust the delay if needed

How it works:
- If you set 'Q' as the trigger: Pressing Q will tap Q once
- If you use a different trigger key: Pressing it will tap Q twice

IMPORTANT TIPS
-------------
1. Always run the program as administrator
2. The window stays on top unless minimized
3. You can show/hide the debug console from the View menu
4. Both features can be used at the same time
5. Changes to settings take effect immediately

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
If keys aren't working:
- Make sure you're running as administrator
